# [Yet Another Weather App](https://thatsinewave.github.io/YetAnotherWeatherAPP)

Welcome to Yet Another Weather App! Because, you know, the world definitely needs another one of these.
This is a simple weather application built out of sheer boredom.
It fetches weather data from the Open Meteo API based on user-provided location information and displays it in a minimalistic UI.
Nothing groundbreaking here, just another addition to the millions of weather apps out there.
